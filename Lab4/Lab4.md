## 2. Why is it important to choose a license?
A license serves multiple purposes for open source projects. It is important because without a license, specifically an OSI approved license, a project cannot be considered open source. Along with that, all OSI licenses guarantee the four freedoms of free software, allowing your project to properly be used, inspected, changed, and redistributed without issue.

## 3. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
If you use a project that doesn't explicitly have a license, you leave yourself at the mercy of the project owner. They could randomly change their project to have a very resrtictive license, and if they don't have any license then they are NOT open source. It leaves yourself vulnerable to wasting a large amount of time if the project claims all of your work with a new license, or a myriad of other things that could cause you to lose work you spent time on.

## 4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?
I do agree with this claim. For the vast majority of users, the configuration required due to the modularity of the system is far too complicated and intimidating. The simplicity of using a singular application, the browser, to visit anything you might want is much more intuitive to less technically advanced users, even if overall less optimal.

## 5. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? 
### Linux uses the GPL v2 License
Linux uses the GPL v2 license because it allows full modification of the OS while still being distinctly a Linux distro. This allows users to hack and mod the operating system to their hearts content, for whatever purpose they need it for. The Linux foundation's mission statement is 
> "The Linux Foundation is dedicated to building sustainable ecosystems around open source projects to accelerate technology development and industry adoption." [(Linux Foundation)](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/). 

The Linux Foundation is one of the key reasons open source is not only so popular, but so feasible, due to their continued support of the community.
Along with these reasons, the GPL v2 is very resilient towards license changes, protecting the users from malicious behavior at the hands of some ill-meaning person. A user on stackoverflow stated 

>"...Linux does not require contributors to assign copyright to some central person. Copyright on it is spread out among many, many people (including some who are dead, in which case much effort would be required to figure out who inherited the copyright). "[(StackOverflow)](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1774/why-does-linux-still-use-the-gplv2).
 
This stability in the license makes it a very enticing option for maintaining the foundation over generations and generations, as a resilient force for open source.

## 10. Take 5 projects from [Observatory](http://rcos.io/projects) or [past RCOS Projects](https://rcos.io/projects/past) and create a table for which project has which license.

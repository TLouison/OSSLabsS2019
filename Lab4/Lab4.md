## 2. Why is it important to choose a license?
A license serves multiple purposes for open source projects. It is important because without a license, specifically an OSI approved license, a project cannot be considered open source. Along with that, all OSI licenses guarantee the four freedoms of free software, allowing your project to properly be used, inspected, changed, and redistributed without issue.

## 3. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
If you use a project that doesn't explicitly have a license, you leave yourself at the mercy of the project owner. They could randomly change their project to have a very restrictive license, and if they don't have any license then they are NOT open source. It leaves yourself vulnerable to wasting a large amount of time if the project claims all of your work with a new license, or a myriad of other things that could cause you to lose work you spent time on.

## 4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher. Do you agree with this claim?
I do agree with this claim. For the vast majority of users, the configuration required due to the modularity of the system is far too complicated and intimidating. The simplicity of using a singular application, the browser, to visit anything you might want is much more intuitive to less technically advanced users, even if overall less optimal.

## 5. Can you justify why such a license is chosen based on the history, goals and philosophy of the project? 
### Linux uses the GPL v2 License
Linux uses the GPL v2 license because it allows full modification of the OS while still being distinctly a Linux distro. This allows users to hack and mod the operating system to their hearts content, for whatever purpose they need it for. The Linux foundation's mission statement is 
> "The Linux Foundation is dedicated to building sustainable ecosystems around open source projects to accelerate technology development and industry adoption." [(Linux Foundation)](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/). 

The Linux Foundation is one of the key reasons open source is not only so popular, but so feasible, due to their continued support of the community.
Along with these reasons, the GPL v2 is very resilient towards license changes, protecting the users from malicious behavior at the hands of some ill-meaning person. A user on stackoverflow stated 

>"...Linux does not require contributors to assign copyright to some central person. Copyright on it is spread out among many, many people (including some who are dead, in which case much effort would be required to figure out who inherited the copyright). "[(StackOverflow)](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1774/why-does-linux-still-use-the-gplv2).
 
This stability in the license makes it a very enticing option for maintaining the foundation over generations and generations, as a resilient force for open source.

## 6. Think of an example project for your Table. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
Example project: Email bot that sends memes according to date or day of the week

License: MIT License

## 7. Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good
Developer: GPL

Company: Apache/BSD

Common Good: LGPL

## 8. Create a repository and choose a license.

## 9. Write five sentences about choosing a project to work on in this course, who will be users/customers of such a project, and what license you would choose.
I would love to work on a project that is IoT based, because I am very passionate about control and automation. If I were to create a project, it would likely be an app (either iOS or Android) that allows for more interesting routines than are currently available on Google Home's platform. I want to set up a wake up platform, that will slowly turn on your lights while telling you the time and encouraging you to wake up. This would be useful for people like me, who hate getting up in the morning, and would prefer to be eased awake naturally instead of being blasted by a blaring alarm. I would likely choose the GPL v3 license in order to allow my project to remain open source, while keeping all derivatives visible and available.

## 10. Take 5 projects from [Observatory](http://rcos.io/projects) or [past RCOS Projects](https://rcos.io/projects/past) and create a table for which project has which license.
